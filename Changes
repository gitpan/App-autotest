  the method "with" which is introduced in that version.

  [BUGS]

  Corrected a minor bug in a test: I guessed the order of directory entries.
  Thanks to CPAN Testers this was caught.

  The POD for autotest contained duplicate entries since I typed (manually)
  what Dist::Zilla adds (automatically).
